# NyxProxy-OSS Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and adjust the settings

proxy:
  # Proxy type: socks5 or https
  type: socks5

  # Address to listen on (0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)
  listen_address: 0.0.0.0

  # Port to listen on (common: 1080 for SOCKS5, 8080 for HTTPS)
  listen_port: 1080

  # Authentication credentials (required)
  username: admin
  password: change_me_please

network:
  # Network interface to use for outgoing connections
  # Leave empty to auto-detect or use "setup" command
  interface_name: ""

  # Enable IPv4 for outgoing connections
  ipv4_enabled: true

  # Enable IPv6 for outgoing connections
  ipv6_enabled: false

  # IPv6 subnet for rotating IPs (e.g., "2a05:f480:1800:25db::/64")
  # Only works on providers that support /64 routing (Vultr, OVH, Hetzner Dedicated, etc.)
  # Leave empty to disable rotating IPs
  ipv6_subnet: ""

  # Enable rotating IPv6 addresses (requires ipv6_subnet and ipv6_enabled)
  # Each connection will use a different random IPv6 from the subnet
  # The IPs are automatically assigned to the interface before use
  rotate_ipv6: false

  # IPv6 Rotation Settings (only used if rotate_ipv6 is true)
  # Number of IPs in the rotation pool (default: 200)
  # Larger pool = more IPs but longer startup time
  ipv6_pool_size: 200

  # Max number of times an IP can be used before rotation (default: 100)
  # Lower = more frequent rotation, higher = less overhead
  ipv6_max_usage: 100

  # Max age in minutes before an IP is rotated (default: 30)
  # After this time, IP will be replaced with a fresh one
  ipv6_max_age: 30

monitoring:
  # Enable monitoring endpoint
  enabled: true

  # Port for monitoring endpoint
  port: 9090

  # Allow remote access to monitoring (false = localhost only)
  allow_remote: false

logging:
  # Debug level: 0 = none, 1 = basic, 2 = detailed
  debug_level: 1
